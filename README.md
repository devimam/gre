# GRE Flashcards

The main purpose of this project is to create a flashcard for all the important GRE words listed in different books. Right now I have managed to include words from the Barron's Essential Words for the GRE and Magoosh 1000 GRE Vocabulary. I have a plan to update the vocabulary list in future.
